PROJECT AURALIS
1. Introduction
This project is a Pokémon-based game implemented as a bot-first system, designed to be
fully playable without requiring any external resources such as websites, wikis, or third-party
tools.
The game focuses on:
● Structured PvE progression
● Strategic combat
● Long-term Pokémon development
● Player-driven economy and trading
● Event-based and repeatable content
The bot acts as the sole interface for gameplay, progression, interaction, and rewards. All
mechanics are designed to work asynchronously, meaning players do not need to be online
simultaneously to interact with systems such as trading, raids, auctions, or dungeons.
The game uses official Pokémon regions, Pokémon, and mechanics (Generation 8
baseline) while selectively disabling or postponing certain mechanics to maintain balance and
clarity in Phase 1.
2. Features
No Feature
1. Pokedex – Phase 1 Design
1. Scope
● Covers only Region 1 + 2 Pokémon.
● Includes all relevant stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense,
Speed.
● Includes types, evolutions, learnable moves, and abilities.
● No external sources needed for the player; all data is preloaded or cached locally.
2. Player Interaction
● Players can view all Pokémon in the Pokedex, regardless of whether they’ve caught
them.
● Optional distinction:
○ “Pokedex” = all Pokémon info, fully accessible.
○ “PokeGuide” = additional information for moves, evolutions, tips, lore.
● Suggestion: For Phase 1, keep just one unified Pokedex to reduce complexity;
PokeGuide can be added later if needed.
3. Completion Rewards
● Not planned for Phase 1.
● Can be added later (e.g., rewards for 50%, 100% completion).
4. Tracking Details
● Each Pokémon tracks:
○ Level caught
○ Shiny status
○ Nickname
○ Gender
○ Abilities
● This allows for future features like breeding, EV training, and trading.
5. Data Source
● Use PokeAPI to fetch stats, moves, and evolutions initially.
● Cache locally in JSON / database for fast access and offline stability.
● This keeps the bot independent of live API calls during gameplay.
✅ Design Decision / Suggestion
● Unified Pokedex in Phase 1 to avoid unnecessary complexity.
● Progressive unlocks (seen vs. caught) can be added later if desired, but players can
view all Pokémon immediately.
● All moves and stats stored locally for instant lookup in battle or party management.
2. Pokémon Feature – Phase 1 Final Design
This feature is the player’s Pokémon collection manager, showing all Pokémon owned and
providing detailed info, outside and inside battles.
1. Collection Overview
● Grouped by species: Duplicates are shown as one entry in the main list.
● Click a species → shows all instances of that species owned.
● Sorting options:
○ Level
○ Nature
○ IV/EV (if implemented)
○ Moveset
○ Gender
○ Shiny status
● Allows players to quickly find and manage Pokémon without being overwhelmed by
duplicates.
2. Individual Pokémon Details
● Select a specific Pokémon instance → shows:
○ ID (unique per instance)
○ Level
○ Nature
○ Shiny / Gender
○ Status (if applicable)
○ Evolution readiness
○ Moveset
○ Optional: EV/IV split
○ Optional: Stats summary
● Buttons:
○ View Stats
○ View IV/EV
○ View Moveset
○ Heal (outside battle)
○ Evolution confirmation (manual)
○ Delete/Replace Move when learning new move
3. Battle/Combat Relevance
● Pokémon details are used in battle:
○ Level, stats, moves, status, type, abilities
● Heals automatically after battle if enabled (like Pokémon Centers or items).
● Notifications:
○ Pokémon ready to evolve
○ Pokémon learned a new move
○ Pokémon needs to forget a move to learn a new one
4. Data Structure (Phase 1)
Each Pokémon instance stored as:
{
"instance_id": 12345,
"species_id": 25,
"nickname": "Sparky",
"level": 25,
"nature": "Jolly",
"shiny": false,
"gender": "male",
"current_hp": 70,
"status": null,
"moves": ["Thunderbolt", "Quick Attack", "Iron Tail", "Agility"],
"evs": {"hp": 0, "atk": 0, "def": 0, "spa": 0, "spd": 0, "spe": 0},
"ivs": {"hp": 31, "atk": 31, "def": 31, "spa": 31, "spd": 31, "spe":
31},
"ready_to_evolve": true,
"experience": 15000,
"fainted": false
}
● EVs/IVs: Can be simplified initially but included for future features (training, breeding,
etc.).
● Unique ID allows multiple instances of the same species to be tracked individually.
5. Moves Management
● Maximum of 4 moves per Pokémon.
● When learning a new move, player chooses which existing move to forget (manual
selection).
● Moves can also be viewed and managed outside battle.
6. Evolution
● Manual evolution method.
● Notification is triggered when level or condition is met.
● Player confirms evolution from UI.
7. Suggestions / Enhancements
● Implement filter + sort system at the species and instance level for easy management.
● Show quick info summary for each Pokémon in the species list (Level, Nature, Shiny).
● Make stat/IV/EV views collapsible so the UI remains clean.
● Consider batch actions later (heal multiple Pokémon, mass transfer to storage).
✅ Phase 1 Feature Takeaways
● Fully supports collection management for multiple instances.
● Works outside battles for healing, move management, and evolution.
● Supports battle-relevant data automatically.
● Includes notifications for level-ups, moves learned, evolution readiness.
● Manual evolution and move deletion method implemented.
3. Team / Party – Phase 1 Final Design
1. Core Functionality
● Players can have up to 6 Pokémon per team/party.
● Players can save up to 6 different teams/parties.
● Before any battle or activity, players can select which team to use.
● Players can also set a “Main Team” that is used as default in other activities
(exploration, raids, dungeons).
2. Player Interaction
● View Teams: Shows Pokémon with only summary info (e.g., Level, Type, Nickname, or
any display fields set in Pokémon feature).
● Swap Pokémon: Replace Pokémon from storage into a team.
● Reorder Pokémon: Change their battle order.
● Select Team: Pick which saved team to use for upcoming activities.
● Set Main Team: Assign one team as default for non-battle activities.
● Favorite Pokémon: Flag Pokémon to prevent accidental removal from any team.
Note: In Phase 1, viewing full Pokémon info is done only in the Pokémon feature, not in the
team menu.
3. Rules & Constraints
● Maximum 6 Pokémon per team.
● No restrictions on duplicates — a team can have multiple of the same species.
● Party changes only allowed outside battle.
● Team selection applies per activity, so players can change before raids, PVP, or
exploration.
4. Data Structure
For each player:
{
"main_team": 1,
"teams": {
"1": [12345, 23456, 34567, 45678, 56789, 67890],
"2": [78901, 89012, 90123, 101234, 112345, 123456],
"3": [...],
"4": [...],
"5": [...],
"6": [...]
},
"favorites": [12345, 78901, 23456]
}
● teams → array of Pokémon instance IDs.
● favorites → Pokémon that cannot be accidentally removed from a team.
5. Suggestions / Enhancements
● Team quick preview: Show Level + Type icons for each Pokémon in the team.
● Auto-sort option: Sort by Level, Type, or Favorite.
● Phase 2: Display held items or abilities in team preview.
● Optional: Team naming for easier recognition (e.g., “PvP Team”, “Raid Team”).
✅ Phase 1 Takeaways
● Multi-team support enhances player flexibility.
● Reordering, swapping, and main team selection give full control.
● Favorites prevent accidental removals.
● Minimal UI clutter while fully functional.
4. Factions – Phase 1 Final Design
1. Core Concept
● Factions are guild-like structures, but:
○ Faction types are predefined by the game, not player-created freely.
○ Players cannot create arbitrary factions.
● A player may become a Faction Leader only if:
○ They possess a Faction Creation Card.
○ They choose one predefined faction.
○ Bot/Admin approval is granted.
This keeps faction lore, balance, and population under control.
2. Faction Creation Rules
● Faction Creation Card:
○ Extremely rare.
○ Obtained via events or special rewards.
● When used:
○ Player selects one predefined faction.
○ Request goes into approval queue.
○ On approval:
■ Player becomes Faction Leader.
■ Faction is activated (or reactivated if dormant).
No card → no creation.
3. Membership Rules
● Players can:
○ Apply to join a faction.
○ Leave a faction voluntarily.
● Leaving or being kicked triggers a:
○ Cooldown of ~2 weeks before joining another faction.
● A player can belong to only one faction at a time.
This discourages faction hopping and enforces commitment.
4. Roles & Hierarchy
Each faction has:
Role Count Permissions
Leader 1 Full control
Vice Leader / Captain 2 Manage members, accept/reject
applications
Member Remaining Participate only
●
Vice Leaders are assigned by the Leader.
● No emblem customization (icons are predefined).
5. Faction Levels (Stars)
● 1★ Faction
○ Max members: 50
● 3★ Faction
○ Max members: 100
● Star upgrades:
○ Not implemented in Phase 1
○ Placeholder exists in data model for Phase 2/3.
6. Player Interaction (Phase 1)
Players can:
● View all available factions.
● View faction details:
○ Name
○ Star level
○ Member count
○ Leader & Vice Leaders
● Apply to join a faction.
● Leave a faction (with cooldown).
No faction chat, bonuses, or raids yet.
7. Data Structure (Phase 1)
{
"faction_id": 1,
"name": "Valor Order",
"predefined": true,
"stars": 1,
"leader_id": 12345,
"vice_leaders": [23456, 34567],
"members": [12345, 23456, 34567, ...],
"max_members": 50,
"created_via_card": true
}
Player side:
{
"player_id": 12345,
"faction_id": 1,
"role": "Leader",
"join_cooldown_until": null
}
8. Explicitly Excluded in Phase 1
● Faction chat
● Faction raids
● Faction buffs
● Emblem customization
● Star upgrades
(All reserved for Phase 2 / Phase 3)
✅ Phase 1 Takeaways
● Strong control over faction creation
● Prevents spam, abuse, and imbalance
● Encourages long-term commitment
● Fully compatible with future Raids, PvP, and faction wars
5. Raids – Phase 1 (Final Design)
1. Core Definition
● Raids are high-difficulty PvE boss battles.
● Bosses are single powerful Pokémon with inflated stats.
● Raids are not faction-based in Phase 1.
● Participation is ticket-based and limited daily.
2. Raid Tiers
There are 3 tiers per raid:
Tier Difficulty Players
Needed
Catch
Chance
Tier 1 Easy 4–5 25%
Tier 2 Medium 7–8 10%
Tier 3 Hard 9–10 1%
●
Up to 10 players max
● Raid can start with a minimum of 2 players
● Raid start requires player voting
3. Turn & Timer System
● Raids use turn-based combat
● Each player has a fixed number of turns
● Failure conditions:
○ Turn limit exceeded
○ All Pokémon faint
● On failure:
○ Boss HP resets to 100%
This avoids partial progress abuse.
4. Boss Mechanics
● Boss Pokémon have:
○ Extremely high HP
○ Boosted stats
○ Increased shiny rate vs wild encounters
● Status effects:
○ Allowed
○ Boss may resist some effects (configurable later)
5. Catch Mechanics
After the boss is defeated:
● Each participant gets one independent catch attempt
● Catch success chance depends on tier:
○ Easy → 25%
○ Medium → 10%
○ Hard → 1%
● Shiny bosses:
○ Much lower catch success rates
● Failure does not consume extra tickets
6. Raid Menu (UI / Commands)
Raid menu contains:
1. Search Active Raids
○ Shows available raids
2. Set Raid Pokémon
○ Choose which Pokémon instance will participate
3. Join Raid
○ Uses 1 Raid Ticket
4. View Raid Info
○ Tier, boss, players joined, turns left
7. Tickets, Limits & Refresh
● Players receive:
○ 1 Raid Ticket daily
● Raid participation limit:
○ 1 raid per 24 hours
● Available raids:
○ ~20 raids active at a time
○ Refresh every 20 hours
This prevents farming while keeping activity high.
8. Failure & Abuse Protection
● If raid fails:
○ Boss HP fully restores
○ Ticket is consumed
● Prevents chip-damage exploitation
● Encourages coordination
9. Limited / Event Raids (Phase 1 – Special Case)
Event Raid Rules
● Boss is:
○ Extremely rare Pokémon
● Raid duration:
○ Lasts several hours
● No simultaneous participation required
● No player limit
Mechanics
● Players contribute damage over time
● Boss HP persists across players
● Rewards distributed:
○ Based on individual contribution
● If boss defeated before timer ends:
○ All contributors receive rewards
Catch Rules
● Can be:
○ Guaranteed encounter
○ Or special drop-based capture (to decide later)
10. Explicitly Excluded (Phase 1)
● Faction raid bonuses
● Raid leaderboards
● Shield phases
● Enrage mechanics
● Raid roles (tank/support)
(All planned for Phase 2+)
11. Data Model (Simplified)
{
"raid_id": 301,
"tier": 2,
"boss_species_id": 384,
"max_players": 10,
"current_players": 7,
"turns_per_player": 5,
"status": "waiting"
}
Event raid:
{
"event_raid_id": 9001,
"boss_species_id": 493,
"total_hp": 5000000,
"remaining_hp": 1200000,
"end_time": "2025-12-18T18:00:00Z"
}
✅ Phase 1 Raid System Summary
● Clear difficulty scaling
● Controlled participation
● High-risk, high-reward loop
● Independent catch chances
● Event raids introduce global collaboration
● Fully expandable for faction integration later
✅ Raid System — FINAL LOCK (Phase 1)
Core Identity
● Raids are:
○ Group-based PvE
○ 4–10 players
○ High-difficulty, cooperative content
● Two categories:
○ Daily Raids
○ Event Raids
● Cooldowns are separate for each category
⭐ Raid Star Tiers
⭐ 1-Star Raid
● Boss Pokémon:
○ Normal species
○ Increased stats
● Designed for:
○ Casual groups
○ Entry-level raid content
⭐⭐ 2-Star Raid
● Boss Pokémon:
○ Stronger species
○ Further increased stats
● Requires:
○ Basic coordination
○ Decent team balance
⭐⭐⭐ 3-Star Raid
● Boss Pokémon:
○ Very hard to clear
○ High stats and optimized moves
● Requires:
○ Coordinated teams
○ Strong type coverage
⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4-Star Raid
● Boss Pokémon:
○ Extremely difficult
○ Intended for:
■ Legendary
■ Mythical
■ Pseudo-Legendary focused teams
● Considered near-impossible without preparation
✔ Clear, intuitive difficulty ladder.
⚔️ Raid Battle Rules
Turns
● Each player receives 10 turns
● Turn usage is individual, not shared
Win / Loss Conditions
● Raid ends when:
○ Boss Pokémon is defeated, or
○ All player Pokémon are wiped out
● If raid fails:
○ Boss HP resets to 100%
● No partial progress carryover
✔ Clean, exploit-proof.
🎯 Catching the Raid Boss
● Catch attempt is:
○ Only available after boss defeat
● Catch chance:
○ Low at all star tiers
○ Even lower if the boss is shiny
● Boss shiny chance:
○ Lower than wild encounters at all tiers
✔ Prevents raid farming abuse.
🎁 Rewards
● Raids give:
○ High-value rewards
● Rewards are:
○ Sent via Mail
● Reward content:
○ Currency
○ Items
○ Possibly raid-exclusive loot (to be defined later)
✔ Correct to decouple reward delivery.
🧠 Professional Evaluation
The Raid system is:
● Appropriately punishing
● Clearly tiered
● Cooperative by necessity
● Resistant to abuse
● Designed to scale for future content
Importantly:
● Raids do not replace Dungeons
● Raids do not invalidate wild encounters
● Raids do not flood Legendaries
This is correct live-service thinking.
6. Combat System – Phase 1 (Revised &
Locked)
This is the authoritative version.
1. Battle Type Support
✅ Unchanged
Same combat engine for:
● PvE (wild, trainers)
● Raids
● PvP
● Gyms
● Dungeons
Only configuration differs.
2. Turn System
✅ Confirmed + clarified
● Turn-based
● Turn order:
○ Priority
○ Speed
● Raids:
○ Each player gets exactly 10 turns
○ Turns tracked per player
○ Boss acts after a full round
3. Damage Formula
✅ Confirmed + updated
Base formula stays:
Damage =
(((2 × Level / 5 + 2) × Power × Attack / Defense) / 50 + 2)
× Modifiers
Modifiers in Phase 1 now INCLUDE:
● STAB
● Type effectiveness
● Critical hits
● Random factor (85%–100%)
● Weather
● Items
● Abilities
● Held items
So:
Weather, abilities, and held items are Phase 1, not deferred.
4. Accuracy & Evasion
✅ Confirmed
● Base accuracy per move
● Accuracy & evasion stages:
○ −6 to +6
● Formula unchanged:
Final Accuracy = Move Accuracy × (User Accuracy / Target Evasion)
5. Status Effects
✅ Confirmed with correction
Supported statuses:
Status Effect
Burn Damage per turn + physical attack reduction
only
Poison Damage per turn
Bad
Poison
Increasing damage
Paralysis Speed reduction + chance to fail
Sleep Cannot act for N turns
Freeze Chance to thaw
Confusion Self-damage chance
❌ Burn does NOT reduce Special Attack
Correct — this matches modern Pokémon logic.
6. Moves System (Including Custom Moves)
✅ Confirmed + extended
● Moves are data-driven, not hardcoded
● Supports:
○ Damage only
○ Status only
○ Damage + status
○ Stat changes
○ Multi-effect moves
Custom moves are fully supported.
Example:
{
"name": "Nova Burst",
"power": 95,
"accuracy": 90,
"type": "fire",
"category": "special",
"effects": [
{ "type": "status", "status": "burn", "chance": 20 },
{ "type": "stat", "stat": "spatk", "change": 1, "target": "self" }
]
}
No additional engine logic needed for new moves.
7. Stat Changes & Visibility
✅ Confirmed with restriction
● Stat stages range: −6 to +6
● Internally supported stats:
○ Attack
○ Defense
○ Sp. Attack
○ Sp. Defense
○ Speed
○ Accuracy
○ Evasion
● Only these are shown to players:
○ HP
○ Attack
○ Defense
○ Sp. Attack
○ Sp. Defense
○ Speed
Accuracy & evasion remain hidden mechanics.
8. Items & Held Items (Phase 1)
✅ Updated
Supported in Phase 1:
● Healing items
● Status cure items
● Temporary stat-boost items
● Held items with passive effects
Examples:
● Choice-type items
● Leftovers-style healing
● Damage-boost items
No item scripting explosion — use effect tags.
9. Multi-Player Combat (Raids)
✅ Confirmed
● Players act independently
● Damage tracked per player
● Boss acts after each round
● Turn usage per player (10 max)
10. Battle End Rules
✅ Confirmed
● Pokémon auto-heal after battle
● EXP distributed by participation
● Raid capture phase triggers if boss defeated
11. Explicitly Deferred
✅ Updated list
❌ Deferred:
● Terrain
● Mega / Z / Dynamax
✅ Allowed in Phase 1:
● Weather
● Abilities
● Held items
● Double battles
12. Final Validation
✅ This system now:
● Matches your design intent
● Supports custom content
● Is Pokémon-faithful
● Is bot-friendly
● Will not require refactors later
Combat System Status
🔒 LOCKED FOR PHASE 1
7. PVE
7.1 Region System – Phase 1 (Structured
Summary)
You are defining Region as a container feature that includes:
Region
├── Map
├── Encounter
├── Exploration
└── Destination
This is correct and scalable.
1. Map System
Global Map
● Shows 7 regions (official Pokémon regions).
● Each region is:
○ Unlocked or Locked
● Locked regions:
○ Visible
○ Show “Not unlocked yet”
Region Map
When a region is opened:
● Two options:
○ Cities / Towns
○ Others (Routes, Caves, Beaches, etc.)
Each City / Area has:
● Description
● Rarity
● Unlock state
2. Cities / Towns
● City list (paginated if needed)
● Clicking a city shows:
○ Description
○ Rarity
○ Buttons:
■ Fly
■ Back
Fly Rules
● Flying moves the player’s current location
● Progression rule:
○ To move to the next region, player must:
■ Clear all trainers in current region
■ Obtain 2★ Gym Badges
(This is a strong progression gate)
3. Encounter Feature (Wild Pokémon)
Core Behavior
● Purpose: Catching Pokémon
● Activated from Region → Encounter
● Uses area-based encounter tables
Encounter UI
● Search → finds Pokémon based on chance
● Battle starts
● Additional button:
○ Exit
■ Leaves Encounter mode completely
○ Escape
■ Flees current Pokémon
■ Immediately searches for next Pokémon
This distinction is important and well-designed.
Restrictions
● ❌ Legendary
● ❌ Mythical
● ❌ Pseudo-Legendary
● ❌ Safari Pokémon (separate system)
These have other acquisition paths.
4. Exploration Feature (Non-Combat PvE)
This is resource exploration, not Pokémon encounters.
Flow
1. Choose area (Cave, Route, Beach, etc.)
2. Buttons:
○ Go
○ Back
3. On Go:
○ Costs currency
○ Starts timed exploration (3–6 hours)
4. After timer:
○ Finds:
■ Currency
■ Items
■ Materials
○ Added to Bag automatically
Limits
● Cooldown exists
● Max 2 explorations per day
● Area rarity affects:
○ Item rarity
○ Reward quality
Restrictions
● ❌ No Legendary/Mythical/Pseudo Pokémon here
5. Destination Feature (Structured PvE Progression)
This is the most important PvE mechanic you described.
Destination Flow
1. Shows where you can go next
2. Selecting destination:
○ Select Team
○ Confirm
3. System shows:
○ Areas to clear (Routes, Caves, etc.)
4. Each area requires:
○ Defeating a fixed number of AI trainers
Rules While in Destination
● ❌ Cannot change team until area is cleared
● ✔ Items can be used
● After each trainer:
○ Participating Pokémon heal 10% HP
● After clearing an area:
○ Full auto-heal
● Losing:
○ You can retry
○ Only the current area resets, not all previous areas
Completion
● After all areas cleared:
○ Destination reached
○ Progression unlocked
This is excellent difficulty pacing.
6. Region Unlock Rules
To unlock a new region:
● Defeat all trainers in the current region
● Obtain required Gym Badges (2★)
This tightly binds:
● PvE
● Gyms
● Regions
● Player progression
7. Safari Zone
● Exists
● Separate rules
● Separate acquisition system
● Not part of standard Encounter / Exploration
(To be designed later)
Implicit Design Decisions (You Made
These, Whether You Realized It or Not)
These are GOOD decisions:
● PvE is not grind-only, it is route-based
● Team lock during Destination adds real strategy
● Exploration adds non-combat progression
● Regions are meaningful, not cosmetic
● Encounter, Exploration, and Destination are not interchangeable
7.2 Trainer System — Formal Definition
Trainer Scaling (No Fixed Teams)
● Trainers do not have fixed Pokémon teams
● Teams are generated based on:
○ Trainer level
○ Area rarity
○ Region difficulty
● Higher-level trainers:
○ Use stronger Pokémon
○ Better type coverage
○ More optimized movesets
✔ This avoids content exhaustion and hardcoding.
Region Locking Rule
● Trainers cannot use Pokémon from future regions
● Exception:
○ If the player has already unlocked the next region, trainers may use
Pokémon from that region
✔ This preserves narrative progression while avoiding artificial constraints.
AI Complexity by Content Tier
Content Type AI Quality Switching IV/EV
Normal Route Trainers Basic ❌ ❌
High-Rarity Areas Medium ✅ (if viable) Partial
Main PvE (Gyms, Dungeons,
Bosses)
Advanced ✅ Fully
trained
Raids Boss
Logic
N/A Custom
✔ Clear and scalable difficulty tiers.
Trainer Switching Rules
● Switching is:
○ Area-rarity dependent
○ Used only if:
■ Type disadvantage
■ Low HP
■ Strategic advantage
● Low-rarity areas:
○ Trainers mostly stay in unless forced
✔ Prevents frustrating early-game battles.
Trainer Items
● Trainers can use items
● Item usage frequency scales with:
○ Area rarity
○ Trainer importance (Boss > Normal)
✔ Matches mainline Pokémon design.
Rebattling Trainers
● Trainers can be re-battled
● Rewards:
○ Tiered
○ One-time only per trainer
● Rebattles give:
○ EXP
○ Progress
○ No repeat loot
✔ Prevents exploit farming.
Raids Exception
● Raid bosses:
○ Only one Pokémon
○ No switching logic
✔ Correct and clean.
2. Design Evaluation (Professional Assessment)
This Trainer system is:
● Procedural, not static → excellent for bots
● Scales naturally with content difficulty
● Keeps PvE challenging without artificial stat inflation
● Aligns cleanly with your Destination + Region system
● Leaves room for future AI upgrades without refactoring
This is strong system design, not just feature stacking.
3. Edge Cases & Resolutions (Preemptive)
Edge Case 1: Overpowered Random Teams
Resolution
● Add internal caps per area:
○ Max BST
○ Max move tier
○ Max IV total
Edge Case 2: Trainer Switching Spam
Resolution
● Cooldown on AI switching
● Or limit switches per battle for non-boss trainers
Edge Case 3: Player Grinding Rebattles
Resolution
● One-time rewards only (already confirmed)
● Optional diminishing EXP after multiple rematches
7.3 Gym System — FINAL LOCKED SPECIFICATION
General Rules
● Gyms are:
○ One-time clear only
○ No healing during Gym battles
● Gym attempts do not affect teams outside Gyms
● Gym Leaders can be re-challenged only for practice, but:
○ No repeat rewards
Gym Structure per Region
● Each region has 8 Gyms
● Gyms are ordered (Gym 1 → Gym 8)
● Difficulty increases naturally through team size and AI
Gym Pokémon Count by Star Tier
Gyms 1–3
● 1★ → 3 Pokémon
● 2★ → 4 Pokémon
Gyms 4–6
● 1★ → 4 Pokémon
● 2★ → 5 Pokémon
Gyms 7–8
● 1★ → 5 Pokémon
● 2★ → 6 Pokémon
All Gyms (3★)
● 3★ → 6 Pokémon
✔ Excellent pacing. This mirrors classic Pokémon difficulty escalation.
🔄 Switching Rules (Very Important, Well-Designed)
Let T = team size used by the Gym Leader
● 1★ → ⌊T / 2⌋ switches
● 2★ → ⌊T / 2⌋ + 1 switches
● 3★ → Unlimited switches
✔ This creates:
● Strategic pressure at low stars
● Full freedom at high difficulty
● No switch abuse early
🧰 Item Usage Rules
● Items are allowed at all star tiers
● No restriction on:
○ Item type
○ Quantity
● Balance is handled via:
○ No healing between battles
○ Increasing AI intelligence
✔ Clean and flexible. Good call.
🧠 Gym AI & Pokémon Quality
● Gym difficulty ignores player trainer level
● Pokémon quality increases by star tier:
○ 1★ → No EVs
○ 2★ → Fully trained IVs/EVs
○ 3★ → Maximum optimization + advanced AI
● No future-region Pokémon unless region is unlocked
🔓 Progression Impact
● To unlock the next region:
○ All 8 Gyms must be cleared at 2★
● Flying is unaffected
🧠 Professional Evaluation
This Gym system :
● Difficulty scales on multiple axes:
○ Team size
○ AI intelligence
○ Switching limits
● No artificial stat inflation
● No grind-based gating
● Clear skill checkpoints
● Optional 3★ content for endgame players
✅ Dungeon System — Formal Definition (Phase-1 Ready)
Core Identity
● Dungeons are:
○ PvE
○ Solo
○ Event-based
○ Resetting over time
● They receive updates over time
● Designed for endgame challenge + competition
This aligns perfectly with your earlier statement that Dungeons are the main competitive
PvE mode.
🏰 Dungeon Structure
Floors
● Total floors: 50
● Future expansion potential: up to 100
Boss Distribution
● Mini Boss Floors:
○ 5
○ 15
○ 35
○ 45
❌ 25 excluded intentionally
● Main Boss Floors:
○ 10
○ 20
○ 30
○ 40
❌ 50 excluded
● Special Floors:
○ 25 → Mid-Dungeon Apex
○ 50 → Final Dungeon Apex (current endpoint)
✔ Very good pacing and psychological checkpoints.
⚔️ Difficulty Scaling
General Floors (1–24)
● Standard dungeon enemies
● Progressive difficulty increase
Post-Midpoint (25+)
● Enemies have:
○ Perfect IVs
○ Trained EVs
○ Stronger / optimized movesets
● Boss difficulty spikes significantly
✔ This makes Floor 25 a true wall, not just a number.
🧪 Random Status Mechanic (Key Feature)
● At every floor:
○ A random status condition is applied
○ Applies to:
■ Player team
■ Enemy team
● Status persists for that floor only
✔ This adds:
● Variability
● Replay value
● Anti-meta protection
Very strong design choice.
💾 Save System (Critical & Well Done)
● Auto-save every 5 floors
● Save points at:
○ 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50
● If wiped:
○ Player restarts from the last save floor +1
○ Example:
■ Wipe at Floor 8 → restart from Floor 6
✔ This is fair, non-frustrating, and bot-friendly.
🚪 Entry Flow
1. Open Dungeon
2. Welcome message
3. Enter Dungeon
4. Choose Team
5. Pay entry cost (first time only)
6. Teleported to Floor 1
✔ Clean and intuitive.
🏁 Leaderboard & Competition
● Leaderboard tracks:
○ Fastest full clear
● Used for:
○ Prestige
○ Competitive motivation
● No time restriction during runs
✔ Allows optimization without forcing speedruns.
🎁 Rewards Philosophy
● Strong rewards overall
● Major reward spikes at:
○ Floor 25
○ Floor 50
● Rewards include:
○ Rare / powerful items
○ Potentially game-changing content
✔ Correct to delay exact reward definition to the Rewards section.
🔒 Dungeon Status
DUNGEON SYSTEM: LOCKED FOR PHASE 1
No contradictions with:
● Trainers
● Gyms
● PvE rules
● Items
● Teams
🧠 Professional Evaluation
This Dungeon system is exceptionally well thought out for a bot game:
Strengths
● Clear mid and end checkpoints
● Save system prevents burnout
● Random status keeps runs fresh
● Competitive without direct PvP
● Scales cleanly to 100 floors later
● Event framing allows seasonal refreshes
Minor Risk (Manageable)
● Random status could create extreme edge cases
→ Easily solved by:
○ Excluding certain statuses on boss floors
○ Or weighting probabilities
This is not a flaw—just tuning.
🔁 Team Switching Rules (Important Update)
Before Floor 25
● Team is locked
● No switching teams mid-run
After Floor 25
Players can switch teams at:
● Every 5 floors
(30, 35, 40, 45)
● Special floors:
○ 28
○ 38
○ 43
○ 48
✔ This is excellent design:
● Floor 25 acts as a hard gate
● Post-25 becomes more strategic, not just stat-based
● Encourages roster depth
🚪 Exit Dungeon (New Rule)
● During Dungeon battles:
○ Player can choose Exit
● Exit behavior:
○ Dungeon run is paused
○ Progress is not lost
● When the player re-enters the Dungeon:
○ They are automatically teleported to the last save/checkpoint
✔ Very user-friendly and essential for long dungeon runs.
🔄 Dungeon Reset System (Very Important & Well
Designed)
Clear Dungeon Data
● Player can:
○ Reset their dungeon progress
○ Start again from Floor 1
● Reset requires:
○ Another entry fee
● On reset:
○ Player selects a new team
○ All previous progress is cleared
✔ This enables:
● Speedrunning
● Leaderboard optimization
● Experimentation
● Replayability without abuse
💾 Save Point System (Confirmed & Extended)
● Auto-save at every 5 floors
● If wiped:
○ Restart from last save floor +1
● Exit + re-entry:
○ Teleports player to last saved checkpoint
✔ Consistent and intuitive.
🧠 Updated Professional Evaluation
The Dungeon system:
Strengths
● Long-session friendly (Exit + Save)
● Competitive (Leaderboard + Reset)
● Strategic depth (post-25 team switching)
● Strong risk–reward loop (entry fees + strong rewards)
● Excellent replay value for a bot-based game
1️⃣Combat Design Philosophy (LOCKED)
Primary rule
● Use PokéAPI as the authoritative data source
● Apply controlled overrides only when:
○ It simplifies implementation without
○ Breaking PvE systems (Gyms, Dungeons, Raids)
This is the correct stance. You are not committing to blind accuracy nor unnecessary
abstraction.
2️⃣Generation & Feature Scope (LOCKED)
Generation Rules
● Generation 8 mechanics
● Explicitly excluded in Phase 1:
○ Mega Evolution
○ Z-Moves
○ Dynamax / Gigantamax
✔ This keeps combat modern but manageable.
3️⃣Core Combat Ruleset (Phase 1 – LOCKED)
🔁 Turn Order
● Determined by:
○ Speed stat
○ Move priority
● Ties:
○ Random resolution
⚔️ Damage Moves
● Standard Pokémon damage formula
● Uses:
○ Base Power
○ Attack / Defense or Sp. Atk / Sp. Def
○ STAB
○ Type effectiveness
○ Random variance
No simplification here — this must stay faithful.
💥 Critical Hits
You asked:
“Can crit to a maximum of 1.5? Or 2?”
Recommendation (Locked for Phase 1):
● Critical hit multiplier = 1.5×
● Crit rate:
○ Gen 8 standard stages
● Crit ignores:
○ Negative stat changes on attacker
○ Positive stat changes on defender
✔ 1.5× is safer for balance across:
● Raids
● Dungeons
● Gyms
2× crits would introduce unnecessary volatility.
🎯 Accuracy & Evasion
● Fully supported
● Uses standard stage system:
○ Accuracy stages
○ Evasion stages
● Moves can:
○ Modify accuracy
○ Modify evasion
○ Bypass checks (where applicable)
✔ This is required for strategic depth.
🧪 Status Conditions (Phase 1)
Supported:
● Burn
● Poison
● Badly Poisoned
● Paralysis
● Sleep
● Freeze
Rules:
● Status effects apply per Gen 8 behavior
● Status damage ticks at end of turn
✔ Clean and consistent with your earlier correction.
🌦 Weather (Phase 1 – Enabled)
Weather is a fundamental combat system.
Supported:
● Rain
● Sun
● Sandstorm
● Hail
Effects:
● Type damage modifiers
● Passive damage (Sand / Hail)
● Move interactions
● Ability interactions (where enabled)
Weather duration:
● Default turns
● Extended by abilities/items later
✔ Good decision to enable early.
🧬 Abilities (Phase 1 – Partial but Real)
Abilities are enabled, but with scope control.
Phase 1 rules:
● Passive abilities supported:
○ Stat modifiers
○ Weather interaction
○ Immunities
● No abilities that:
○ Trigger entirely new mechanics
○ Require complex event hooks (can be deferred)
PokéAPI provides:
● Ability data
● Triggers
You decide which abilities are active.
✔ This avoids ability-driven technical debt.
🎒 Items in Combat
● Items usable in:
○ PvE
○ Gyms
○ Raids (if allowed by mode)
● Effects:
○ Healing
○ Status curing
○ Stat boosts
Held items:
● Enabled in Phase 1 (as stated earlier)
● Passive effects only
4️⃣Where PokéAPI Is Used vs Overridden
PokéAPI Used For:
● Pokémon base stats
● Types
● Move data
● Accuracy
● Power
● Effects
● Abilities (definitions)
● Learnsets
Overridden / Controlled By You:
● Crit multiplier
● Ability availability
● Move availability
● Status edge cases
● PvE-specific tuning
● Raid boss scaling
This is exactly how serious Pokémon fangames do it.
5️⃣Combat Ruleset Status
COMBAT RULESET: LOCKED FOR PHASE 1
With explicit note:
● Future tuning allowed
● No refactor required later
6️⃣Professional Evaluation
This combat design is:
● Faithful where it matters
● Pragmatic where needed
● Compatible with:
○ Dungeons
○ Gyms
○ Raids
○ Exploration
● Safe for long-term scaling
✅ Bag & Items System — FINAL LOCK (Phase 1)
Bag Capacity
● Bag has unlimited space
● No weight, slot, or stack limits in Phase 1
✔ Correct choice. Inventory friction would add nothing at this stage.
🧳 Bag Sections (Clear & Canonical)
The Bag is split into fixed categories:
1. Medicine
○ Healing
○ Status recovery
2. TMs
○ Move teaching items
3. Held Items
○ Passive combat effects
4. Battle Items
○ Temporary stat boosts
○ Consumables
5. Pokéballs
○ Capture mechanics
6. Other Items
○ Quest
○ Exploration
○ Event-related
✔ This mirrors player expectations and keeps UI simple.
⭐ Item Tier System (5 Tiers)
Items are tiered as:
1. Standard
2. Advanced
3. Celestial
4. Premium
5. Epic
Tier affects:
● Power
● Rarity
● Availability
● Source (PvE / Raids / Dungeons)
✔ Clean naming and scalable.
📦 Boxes / Loot Containers
Box System
● Boxes are a separate acquisition system
● Boxes have 4 tiers
● Each box:
○ Has a fixed probability table
○ Can drop items of multiple tiers
Tier Restrictions
● The highest item tier (Epic):
○ Is NOT obtainable from normal boxes
○ Reserved for:
■ Events
■ Special boxes
■ Limited-time content
✔ This preserves prestige and avoids loot inflation.
🔒 Trading Rules
● Items are NOT tradable in Phase 1
● This avoids:
○ Market abuse
○ Early economy collapse
✔ Correct to delay trading.
🎯 Exclusive Item Sources
Confirmed item exclusivity:
● Raid-exclusive items
● Dungeon-exclusive items
● Event-exclusive items
● Boxes with:
○ Unique drop tables
○ Special reward pools
✔ This gives each PvE mode a unique identity.
🧠 System Evaluation
This Bag & Items system is:
● Modular
● Expandable
● Low maintenance
● Compatible with:
○ Raids
○ Dungeons
○ Exploration
○ Economy
You avoided:
● Inventory micromanagement
● Artificial scarcity
● Overly complex crafting loops (for now)
✅ Economy & Rewards System — FINAL LOCK (Phase
1)
💰 Currency Structure
Standard Currency
● Single main currency
● Used for:
○ Gyms
○ Dungeons
○ Raids
○ Exploration
○ Shops (future)
✔ Keeps the economy simple and controllable.
💎 Premium Currency
● Exists
● Can be:
○ Earned via gameplay (rare)
○ Used for:
■ Special boxes
■ Events
■ Convenience (future)
✔ Correct balance between accessibility and value.
🎁 Reward Sources
Rewards come from:
● Gyms
● Dungeons
● Raids
● Exploration
● Events
Each source has:
● Its own reward identity
● Its own box pools
✔ This avoids all content feeling the same.
📦 Box-Based Reward Model (Core Design Choice)
Instead of:
● Pure fixed rewards ❌
● Pure RNG ❌
You use a hybrid model:
Box Rewards
● Rewards are primarily given as Boxes
● Each box:
○ Contains up to 5 items
○ Items can be:
■ Same tier
■ Mixed tiers
● Box drop tables are:
○ Fixed
○ Controlled
○ Source-specific
✔ This is the correct live-service approach.
Fixed Rewards (Supplementary)
Some rewards are always guaranteed, such as:
● Standard currency
● Progress unlocks
● Milestone completions
✔ This prevents frustration and bad streaks.
🚫 No Reward Limits
● No daily caps
● No weekly caps
● No hard limits
Balance is achieved through:
● Difficulty
● Entry costs
● Time investment
● Event gating
✔ This is safe because:
● Your systems are skill-gated, not time-gated
● PvE difficulty scales properly
🔒 Economy Status
ECONOMY & REWARDS: LOCKED FOR PHASE 1
No contradictions with:
● Items & Bag
● Raids
● Dungeons
● Gyms
● Exploration
🧠 Professional Evaluation
Your economy design is:
● Sustainable
● Non-exploitative
● Live-service friendly
● Easy to tune without refactors
● Resistant to inflation (because power is boxed, not raw)
Avoided:
● Multi-currency confusion
● Hard caps that frustrate players
● Excessive RNG frustration
1️⃣Pokedex
Your idea (validated)
● Opens Pokedex
● Shows all Pokémon
● Paginated
● Info fills progressively
Structural confirmation
This is correct and necessary.
Refinement (important)
Split Pokedex into two layers:
A. Global Dex
● Shows all Pokémon silhouettes
● Always visible
● Prevents external wiki dependency
B. Registered Dex
Unlocked by:
● Encounter
● Catch
● Evolution
● Raid participation
This avoids:
● Information overload
● Early-game power knowledge abuse
✔ No balance issues
✔ Phase-1 safe
2️⃣PokeMart (NPC Shop)
Your idea
● Regular shop
● Buy items
Confirmation
Correct. This is your economic anchor.
Locked rules
● Fixed prices
● Limited catalog
● No Pokémon sales
● No dynamic pricing
This prevents:
● Inflation
● Market manipulation
● Early exploit loops
✔ Stable
✔ Required for progression
3️⃣PokeMarket (P2P + P2E)
This is high-impact, so we must be precise.
Your idea
● Dynamic market
● Buy/sell Pokémon
● Buy/sell eggs
● Acts as trading system
What works
● Centralized marketplace instead of direct trading
● Eliminates scam risks
● Scales better than 1-to-1 trades
Critical refinements (must-do)
For Phase 1, restrict scope:
Allowed
● Pokémon
● Eggs
Not allowed yet
● Items
● Boxes
● Currency exchange between premium ↔ normal
Why:
● Items + boxes break economy too early
● Currency arbitrage exploits
Listing rules (suggested)
● Listing fee (small)
● Tax on successful sale
● No instant relist spam
✔ This system replaces traditional trading cleanly
✔ Very strong design choice
4️⃣PokeAuction
This is a separate economic layer, and your design is mostly solid.
Your idea
● Auction duration: max 1 week
● Highest bid lasts 1 day
● Bid refreshes cooldown
● Currency is escrowed
● Auto transfer on win
Validation
This is professionally designed. You already included:
● Escrow protection
● Anti-fake bidding
● Time pressure
One refinement
Add minimum bid increment (percentage-based).
Reason:
● Prevents 1-currency bid wars
● Reduces server spam
✔ Safe
✔ Does not conflict with Market
✔ Auction ≠ instant liquidity (good)
5️⃣Day Care & Breeding
Your idea
● Max 3 Pokémon
● Passive leveling
● Accelerated leveling after 5 hours
● Breeding ignores gender
● Egg moves inherited
What works
● Time-gated progression
● No instant power
● Supports long-term investment
Critical checks
To prevent abuse:
Phase-1 constraints
● No IV inheritance manipulation yet
● No shiny breeding bonuses yet
● Egg move pool limited to predefined list
This keeps:
● EV training relevant
● Dungeons/Raids meaningful
✔ Strong system
✔ Balanced if IV abuse delayed
6️⃣PvP (Deferred)
Correct decision.
PvP must wait until:
● Move balance stabilizes
● Abilities + weather tested
● Economy settles
✔ Correctly postponed
7️⃣Safari Zone
Your idea
● Each region has one
● Entry cost: 30 Safari Balls
Validation
This fits perfectly into your Region Feature.
Structural note
Safari Zone should be:
● No regular Pokéballs
● Limited turn count
● Fixed encounter pool per rotation
This makes it:
● Skill-based
● Not grindable infinitely
✔ Excellent PvE-side feature
8️⃣Mail System
Your idea
● System-generated mail
● Rewards delivery
● Dev / event communication
Confirmation
Mandatory for:
● Raids
● Dungeons
● Auctions
● Market transactions
Must-have rules
● Mail expiry (e.g., 7–14 days)
● Claim button only
● No item sending between players (Phase 1)
✔ Infrastructure feature
✔ Zero balance risk
9️⃣EV Training System
● Player selects EV amount
● Cost-based
● 100 EV/hour
● Max caps enforced
● Auto-calc & refund
● EV training is exclusive while active
(Pokémon cannot battle or daycare simultaneously)
● EV reset (if added later)
1️⃣Overall PokeMarket Architecture
You are correct:
PokeMarket is NOT just a shop — it is the central P2P interaction hub.
PokeMarket contains three sub-systems
1. Market (Buy/Sell – fixed price)
2. Auction House (time-based bidding)
3. Trade Center (direct Pokémon-for-Pokémon trades)
These are logically connected but mechanically isolated, which is exactly what you want.
This avoids:
● Exploit loops
● UI confusion
● Economy instability
✔ Approved structure
2️⃣Buy / Sell System (Fixed-Price Market)
Menu Flow (clean)
PokeMarket
├─ Enter Market
│ ├─ Buy
│ └─ Sell
├─ Trade Center
└─ Auction House
BUY
● Browse listed Pokémon / items
● Filters:
○ Species
○ Level range
○ Nature
○ IV range (later)
○ Shiny toggle
● Pagination mandatory
When buying:
● Currency is deducted instantly
● Pokémon transferred immediately
● Sale tax applied automatically
SELL
● Player selects Pokémon
● Sets price
● Pays a small listing fee
● Pokémon is locked (cannot be used elsewhere)
When sold:
● Currency sent via Mail
● Pokémon removed from listing
Phase-1 restrictions (important)
● ✅ Pokémon
● ❌ Items (add later)
● ❌ Boxes
● ❌ Currency exchange
This prevents:
● Infinite money loops
● Item scarcity collapse
✔ This is stable and scalable
3️⃣Trade Center (Direct Trading)
This is the most delicate system, but your idea is solid.
Purpose
● Pokémon-for-Pokémon trades
● No currency exchange (except fees)
● Social interaction without chat spam
How it works (refined)
Step 1: Create Trade Listing
● Player selects a Pokémon
● Pokémon is locked
● Listing visible in Trade Center
Step 2: Sending a Trade Request
● Another player selects:
○ One of their Pokémon
○ Target trade listing
● Pays a small trade request fee
Request includes:
● Pokémon details
● Sender name
● Time limit (e.g., 24 hours)
Step 3: Recipient Decision
● Accept
● Decline
● Ignore (expires)
Outcomes
● Accept
○ Fee deducted from both players
○ Pokémon swapped
○ Both receive confirmation mail
● Decline
○ Sender gets 1-hour cooldown
○ Fee is NOT refunded (anti-spam)
● Expire
○ No cooldown
○ Fee lost
Why this works
● Prevents trade spam
● Prevents fake negotiations
● No real-time coordination needed
✔ Excellent P2P design for a bot-based game
4️⃣Relationship with Auction House
Important clarification:
● Market → instant liquidity
● Auction → price discovery
● Trade Center → non-monetary exchange
They must not overlap.
Hard rules
● Pokémon listed in one system cannot be listed in another
● Trade Center listings cannot receive currency offers
● Auction listings cannot receive trade offers
This avoids:
● UI abuse
● Cross-system exploits
✔ Keep them isolated
5️⃣Phase-1 Locked Rules (Non-Negotiable)
To keep Phase 1 stable:
Market
● Fixed-price only
● Pokémon only
● Listing fee + sale tax
Trade Center
● Pokémon-for-Pokémon only
● Fee on request
● Cooldown on decline
● No bulk trades
Auction
● Pokémon only
● Minimum bid increments
● Time-limited
Global
● All transfers go through Mail
● Pokémon are locked while listed
● No anonymous listings (player name visible)
6️⃣Risks & Why Your Design Avoids Them
✔ Taxes + fees sink currency
✔ Listing fees + lock-in discourage spam
✔ No direct trades, all escrowed
✔ Cooldowns + fees make it inefficient
✔ Clear separation of Market / Trade / Auction
✅ CONFIRMATION: YOUR INTENT (LOCKED)

4️⃣Your Dungeon Save Priority (Confirmed)
Your model resolves one of the hardest MMO problems correctly.
To restate in technical terms (confirming understanding):
● Save List
○ Authoritative progress marker
○ Updated only on checkpoint floors
○ Has priority over team state
● Team List
○ Mutable, temporary
○ Can be rewritten at allowed floors
○ Discarded if progress fails beyond save
● New List
○ Staging buffer
○ Only committed when save advances
○ Cleared after merge
✔ This is effectively a transactional checkpoint system
✔ No conflict with cooldowns
✔ No exploit path
